<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js TypeScript project for a card upgrade game system case study. The application demonstrates optimized batch processing, security measures, and performance improvements for a card upgrade mechanism.

## Key Technologies
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Lucide React Icons
- API Routes for backend functionality

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow Next.js 14+ App Router patterns
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use server-side data fetching where appropriate
- Implement rate limiting and security measures for API routes
- Optimize for performance with batch operations
- Use TailwindCSS for consistent styling

## Architecture Patterns
- Component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for state management
- API routes for backend logic
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Security-first approach with input validation
- Performance optimization through batching and caching

## Security Considerations
- Always validate input on both client and server side
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Prevent client-side manipulation
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Performance Guidelines
- Use batch operations for multiple card upgrades
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize API calls and reduce network overhead
- Use proper loading states and error handling
- Implement real-time updates where appropriate
